            <p>Hola! <br>
              For those who have had a piece of dokeCorporations on social networks, 
              they' prolly wondering what we are doing on here. We are neither writers nor readers. 
              We don't do any of both, but we test well! 
              Perhaps we should share a little more detail about us..but already we feel like we' talking too much. 
              How do people do this thing tho? Sucks!
              Anyways... we should mention we are free thinkers at dokeCorporations. We love to listen to people 
              and make stupid comments just for the fun! We realize the world is becoming a global bore-place with Capitalism on the rise. People have started to think its a sin to wear a genuine smile. How! So...here is the thing - we know its either of two things - you have a devouring vocation that eats your day for the money; or you don't have such a vocation and you solemnly wish you do. Either ways, we know you are screwed! Lolz. But you shouldn't be. And thats why we are here to punctuate your day with a little kindness - smile. Have fun, smile and possibly break a neck :D  Its not going to be as painful as you think. Our goal is to get you on the smile train...for free. Lolz 'oshofree'. <br>
              You should drop by and enjoy.<br>Cheers.</p>

          <h3 class="post-title">Brainwashing - Killing our instincts</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>You probably have thought things were just proper the way you met them.
              Like how in basic Maths, 2 + 2 = 4 and no one has ever challenged the computations.
               Most often people are lazy to exercise their brains and question some principles.
               Who says it has to be so? Who says 3 has to follow 2?  Lolz. The madness is not limited to aritemetics.
               Most widely known statements have been taken for granted to be true...
               and people of all ages recite them with approval. What nonsense! Take these examples...
               <br> Read this: 'Do not build castles in the air'. Look at the statement again.
               What really is wrong with building castles in the air? The idiom seems hyper instructive...
               which has the propensity of destroying our sense of imagination.
               And yet we use it as an Elder's advice...to not lose touch on reality. Wack!
               <br>Another of this is the widely used statement: "A bird at hand is worth two in the bush" Some individuals have even recreated this statement to read "A bird at hand is worth two in the cage". How stupid! The statement preaches contentment and appreciation of what one already has...with absolutely no willlingness to give up the present for the future. The advice kills the benefit of uncertainty...and implores people not to take risks, howsoever calculated. We know what this does to us na...abi...'nuff said!<br>
               Lets get off the books and move to the streets.
               The one we consider most hilarious are the female dress designers,
               particularly the see-through dress makers. Whosoever started the idea should be stoned.
               The dress largely undermines the imaginative powers of men.
               A lady does not have to bare it all before men see with their minds. R
               emember what Einstein said...imagination is gold - but then,
               these diaper-wearing designers have decided to kill this important power of men,
               and nobody is saying nuffin'.</p>

            <p>I am certainly not a great writer and I should probably contract this story out to a better writer. However, since I am doing this myself, I should just say a few disjointed words.
              10 years of active legal practice, I can say that it has been a great journey punctuated with many challenges, most of which I have fairly overcome.
              I have indeed learnt a great deal and have become a master of the profession - well, an aspect of it - Commercial Practice, to be precise, Banking!<br>
              However, while doing that, it became clearer that the job was not really exciting my brain the way I usually get excited to solve a math problem. This is despite the fact that I swicthed jobs on about 5 ocassions within the 10 years.
              I had often reasoned whether the so called saying - "find a passion and let is be your work" is really something or those successful people just adopt it as their
              slogan, just to get to some of us who have found ourselves in a paid job doing what is required of us in other to get paid.
              In my thoughts, I figured I loved maths, well, not so good at it, but at least I loved the fact that it challenges my brain to think computationally. So, I started
              hanging out with my friends who are engineers and mostly computer scientists.
              And with the help of some websites such as <a href="https://codeacademy.com" target="_blank">code academy</a>,
               <a href="https://udemy.com" target="_blank">udemy</a>,
               <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>,
               <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>
               et al, today, my mind is finally working and it has been fun building things mostly at night. lol</p>
